							<h2>VELLODE BIRD SANCTUARY</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Vellode Bird Sanctuary, established by India's Ministry of Environment & Forests in 1996 near Erode, Tamil Nadu, began as a rain-fed irrigation tank (Periyakulam Eri) that naturally attracted diverse birdlife due to surrounding agricultural fields and fish. Its history involves transforming from a local water body into a protected wetland, recognized as a key habitat for both resident and migratory species like Cormorants, Darters, and Teals, becoming a vital conservation area with tourism infrastructure like observatory towers and an interpretation center, supported by consistent water supply from the Lower Bhavani Project canal system. <br>
