							<h2>ELAKURICHI ADAIKALA MATHA CHURCH.</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Elakurichi Adaikala Matha Church, a significant Catholic pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu, originated in the early 18th century with missionary Constantine Beschi (Veeramamunivar), who built the first shrine around 1711 after Mary's intercession miraculously cured a local king, leading to land donation.

							<h2>KALIYAPERUMAL TEMPLE.</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Kaliyaperumal Temple (Kaliyuga Varadharaja Perumal Temple) in Kallankurichi, Ariyalur, is over 250 years old, founded by a cowherd named Maangan Padayachi who built it around a divine wooden pillar, the main deity, after Lord Vishnu appeared in his dream, revealing it was the original sacred post brought by his ancestors for a temple that was never built. This unique Vishnu temple features a pillar as the primary idol, significant to the Vanniyar community, and is known for its miraculous powers and distinctive worship practices, like the absence of a Sorgavasal. <br>

 FAMOUS THINGS:<br>

	Cashew Nuts (Mundhiri): Ariyalur is known for producing excellent cashews, so buying roasted or raw cashews is a popular choice.<br>
	Temple Products: Near the temple, expect to find common items like small deity idols (clay, metal), incense sticks (dhoop), puja thalis, religious books, and bells for worship.<br>
	Local Handicrafts & Snacks: Look for general handicrafts, traditional snacks like banana chips, and regional spices, though these are typical of the broader Ariyalur district, not specific to this temple. <br>

 SPECIALITY:<br>

	The Kaliyaperumal Temple in Kallankurichi, Ariyalur, is unique for its main deity being a 12-foot-tall pillar (Sattam) held by Lord Hanuman, with no separate idol for Vishnu or his consorts, leading to distinct celebrations like no 'Sorgavasal' (Heavenly Gate) on Vaikuntha Ekadasi, focusing instead on its grand annual car festival and 'Purattasi' Saturdays, all set within Vijayanagara-style architecture with intricate carvings.<br>

							<h2>KARAIVETTI BIRD SANCTUARY</h2>
