Named after the Pandavas and Draupadi from the Mahabharata (Dharmaraja, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula-Sahadeva, and Draupadi Rathas), they showcase early Dravidian architecture, with each structure designed in different South Indian temple styles, though they are not actual chariots and were never consecrated as functional temples, serving as architectural models. <br>
