							<h2>KALVARAYAN HILLS</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>
                Kalvarayan Hills have a rich tribal history, home to Malayali Gounder communities, with
origins tracing back to warriors from Kanchipuram settling among native Vedar people, evolving
into distinct Gounder clans. Historically governed by jagirdars (feudal lords) under systems
inherited from the Vijayanagara Empire, these hills maintained semi-autonomy until the Indian
government took control in 1976 after legal battles, ending jagirdar rule and extensive forest
exploitation. The region, known for its unique landscape, biodiversity (sholas, waterfalls), and
tribal culture, was once considered separate from mainland India, with its own taxation and
customs.<br> 
FAMOUS THINGS:<br>
•                      Forest Products: Look for pure, wild honey, different types of millets (like kambu/
pearl millet), and medicinal herbs sold by local tribal communities.<br>
• Local Delicacies: Try traditional foods such as Kambu Dosai (millet dosa), Ragi Kali (finger
millet porridge), and local sweets like Adhirasam.<br>
• Tribal Crafts: Authentic handicrafts and art from the Malayalee Gounder tribe (the main
inhabitants) might be available.<br>
• Local Produce: Fresh jackfruit and other regional agricultural items are also found here. <br>
TIME:<br>
•         Daytime Focus: 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM (Commonly cited for general visits to hill stations).<br>
• Sunrise/Sunset: Around 6:20 AM to 5:49 PM (These vary slightly by season).<br> 
PEAK HOURS:<br>
•                    Winter (Nov-Feb): Pleasant climate attracts more visitors for sightseeing and nature
walks.<br>
• Summer Festival (May): A local festival draws significant crowds to the hills.<br>
• After Rains: Waterfalls like Megam and Periyar see increased footfall when water levels rise.<br> 
SPECIALITY:<br>
                  Kalvarayan Hills are special for their serene beauty, temperate climate, diverse forests
(sholas, deciduous), waterfalls (Megam, Periyar), Gomukhi Dam, botanical park, and being a
haven for trekkers and nature lovers, home to Malayali tribes, offering a "Poor Man's Hill Station"
escape with rich biodiversity and cultural uniqueness.<br>

where Shiva vanquished the demon Andakasuran. Believed to date back to the Chola era (10th
century) and earlier, with inscriptions from Pallava times, it's a holy site where poet Avvaiyar sang
praises, and even Sri Ramana Maharshi experienced samadhi, making it a key pilgrimage spot
for spiritual relief and historical significance.<br>
