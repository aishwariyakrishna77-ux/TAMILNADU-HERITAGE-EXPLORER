cave where Bhagwan Ramana Maharshi lived (1916-1922) on Tiruvannamalai hill, a historic
place for meditation, and a modern temple in Salem founded by Shantananda Swami (planned
1968, consecrated 1971) dedicated to Skanda and Mahalakshmi, with another Chennai
Skandhashramam established by him for Ugraprathyangira Devi in 1999. Both locations hold
deep spiritual meaning, one linked to a great sage and the other to contemporary spiritual
movements and specific deities, highlighting different facets of Hindu worship.<br> 
FAMOUS THINGS:<br>
Handicrafts & Textiles: Look for unique items like "show on a plate" fiber dolls, dough figures,
wooden crafts with enamel, and the famous plain white Tiruvannamalai sarees with gold

powerfully peaceful spot for meditation, offering stunning panoramic views of Arunachala Hill
and the town, and preserving the simple rooms where he taught and his mother cooked for
devotees. It's known for its tranquil energy, ideal for seekers, but requires a moderate uphill hike,
adding to the spiritual journey. <br>
