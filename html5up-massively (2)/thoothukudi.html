							<h2>PANCHALANKURICHI PALACE.</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Panchalankurichi Fort was the stronghold of 18th-century Polygar Veerapandiya Kattabomman, a key figure in early resistance against the British East India Company, who defied tax demands, leading to fierce battles where the fort was repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt before his execution in 1799, with the current memorial fort built in 1974 by the Tamil Nadu government over its ruins.<br>

Built in 1974 on the original fort's ruins, it features unique architectural elements like pagoda roofs, and houses artifacts from Kattabomman's era, making it a significant cultural and historical site.<br>

							<h2>ETTAIYAPURAM PALACE.</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Ettayapuram Palace, seat of the ancient Ettayapuram Zamindari in Tamil Nadu, originated from the Pandya kingdom, with its rulers appointed by the Madurai Nayaks, evolving from "Ilasanadu" in the 16th century into a significant cultural patron during British rule, fostering Tamil literature (Bharathiyar, Umaru Pulavar), music (violin in Carnatic music), and social reforms like girls' education and temple entry, though the palace itself now stands as a decaying monument, linked to the controversial figure Ettappan and known for its peacocks and cultural legacy. <br>
