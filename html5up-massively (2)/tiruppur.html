							<h2>SIVANMALAI TEMPLE</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>

	Sivanmalai Temple, a significant Murugan shrine near Kangeyam in Tirupur, has ancient roots in the Kongu region, with legends linking it to Sage Sivavakkiyar (who meditated here and is believed to still reside in a cave) and its formation from a piece of the Meru mountain used by Lord Shiva. The temple, patronized by Kongu chieftains and later Vijayanagara rulers, features unique shrines for Sun God and Sani Bhagwan and a famous "Command Box" where devotees receive divine messages for future events, all while glorifying Murugan as "Kangeyan". <br>

 FAMOUS THINGS:<br>

	Divine Offerings: The core attraction is the items revealed in a devotee's dream, placed in a special box for all to see and worship – these aren't "bought" but are part of the unique temple ritual.<br>
	Pooja Items: Standard items for worship, small deity idols, kumkum, vibhuti, and other religious paraphernalia. <br>
	Local Snacks & Sweets: Expect vendors selling traditional South Indian snacks, sweets, and local delicacies.<br>

	Festivals: Major festivals (Thaipusam, Panguni Uthiram) bring massive crowds.<br>
	Early Mornings: Even before sunrise, it can get quite crowded.<br>
	Evenings: The evening Aarti time is also a popular draw.<br> 
   

 SPECIALITY:<br>

	Sivanmalai Temple's main speciality is its unique "Uthiravu Petti" (Command Box), a glass box where Lord Murugan's divine messages appear as objects (like flowers or leaves) in devotees' dreams, guiding them to bring the item for worship, symbolizing divine intervention and predictions. Other highlights include its ancient history (linked to Siddhar Sivavakkiyar), its hilltop location with panoramic views, the unique straight alignment of the Navagrahas (planets) in one line, and its significance as a powerful Murugan shrine outside the main Arupadaiveedu. <br>
