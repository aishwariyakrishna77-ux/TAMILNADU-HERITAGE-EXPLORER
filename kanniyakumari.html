to be where a part of Goddess Sati's body fell, representing her adolescent form. Legend says
she performed penance here to marry Lord Shiva, with the temple's eastern door, featuring a
sparkling diamond nose stud, only opening on special occasions to prevent mariners from
mistaking the light for a lighthouse. Mentions of the temple appear in ancient epics like
the Ramayana and Mahabharata, highlighting its deep historical and cultural roots at India's

architecture and spiritual importance at India's southern tip. <br>
