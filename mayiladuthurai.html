							<h2>POOMPUHAR</h2>
							<p>HISTORY:
Poompuhar (Kaveripattinam) was a legendary ancient port city in Tamil Nadu, a major trade
hub for Early Cholas, flourishing during the Sangam era (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE) with extensive
maritime trade to Rome, Southeast Asia, and beyond, exporting pearls, spices, textiles,
and importing gold/wine. Described vividly in Tamil literature like Silappatikaram, it was a
cosmopolitan city with planned streets, markets, and diverse people, but gradually declined due
to coastal erosion and submergence by the sea, a fate confirmed by marine archaeology finding
submerged structures and Roman artifacts.<br> 
FAMOUS THINGS:<br>               
Thanjavur Art Plates: Unique decorative plates, another hallmark of Thanjavur's craft
heritage.<br>
• Handicrafts: A broad category including pottery, stone sculptures, and fiber art, representing
various regional skills.<br> 
• Brassware: A wide array of items from traditional lamps (like the famous Nachiyar Koil lamps)
to decorative and utility pieces.<br>
TIME:<br>
While attractions like the beach, museum, and lighthouse generally open during daytime,
ferry services run from around 8 AM to 4 PM.<br>
PEAK HOURS:<br>
More people visit Poompuhar during the cooler winter months (November to February)<br>         
• Summer (March-May): Very hot and humid.<br>
• Monsoon (June-September): Moderate to heavy rainfall. <br>
SPECIALITY:<br>
Poompuhar's specialty lies in its rich history as the ancient Chola port city
of Kaveripoompattinam, a legendary hub for maritime trade, and its deep connection to the
Tamil epic Silappatikaram, featuring historical sites like the Silappatikara Art Gallery, a serene
beach where the Kaveri meets the sea, and Dutch-era architecture.<br>
