							<h2>DHANUSHKODI</h2>
							<p> HISTORY:<br>
Dhanushkodi, at India's southeastern tip, blends myth with tragedy, known as the spot
where Lord Rama's mythical bridge (Rama's Setu) to Lanka began, named "End of the
Bow" (Dhanushkodi). Once a thriving port and pilgrimage hub, it was devastated by a
catastrophic cyclone in 1964, turning it into a desolate "ghost town" with ruins, with the
government declaring it unfit for living. Today, it's a poignant reminder of nature's power,

Dhanushkodi's specialty lies in its unique blend of mythological significance
(Ramayana connection to Ram Setu), historical ruins (ghost town), and stunning natural beauty,
being the "tip of the bow" where the Bay of Bengal meets the Indian Ocean, a spiritually charged
place known for its pristine beaches and the haunting remnants of a town destroyed by a 1964
cyclone. <br>
